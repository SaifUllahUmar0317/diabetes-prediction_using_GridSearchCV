# üìù Model Optimization Summary

This project is an **improved version** of my earlier Diabetes
Prediction model.\
Here's what I accomplished during the optimization process:

-   The diabetes predictor app is an ML model trained on the **Pima
    Indian Diabetes dataset**.
-   I previously trained this model without formal tuning; I manually
    selected the model and its hyperparameters.
-   After learning about **hyperparameter tuning**, I used
    **GridSearchCV** to automatically search for the best model and its
    optimized hyperparameters.
-   GridSearchCV provided solid evidence that the chosen model and
    hyperparameters are indeed the best combination for this dataset.
-   As a result, I now have a **validated model** with the best possible
    accuracy and a clear, reproducible process.
